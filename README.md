# facerecognition-security
Using the Kairos Face API to detect unknown faces.

--- NEEDS UPDATED ---

This project is a security system prototype with advanced features. It is being developed on a RaspberryPi with a camera modual contained within an internal network. It currently utilizes the Kairos Face Recognition API to perform its facial recognition tasks. When an unknown face is found, the system sends you an email with the image of the unknown suspect.
